# STATE - CombatAITree

**Goal:** EnhancedCombatAI's brain (DecisionMatrix, skill rolls, cooldowns) driving vanilla leaf
nodes through our own behavior trees, instead of raw animation events. Design: `TREE_DESIGN.md`.

**Owner folder:** D:\Modding\combat-ai-tree (git). Research and tools: D:\Modding\skyrim_re.

**Active version:** 0.4.0 (CURRENT.txt). Releases: `releases\<version>\CombatAITree-<version>.zip`, one per
version so any step can be rolled back.

**Runtime status:**
- 0.1.0 ran 7 min clean. 0.2.0 hung the game (tree cycle), fixed in 0.2.1. 0.2.1 and 0.2.2 ran clean
  (no hang, movement through the tree works without CPR).
- 0.3.0 (includes 0.2.3/0.2.4), run 4: ~4 min against 3 bandits, no hang. The bash intents were all
  taken (115/114). Movement intents ran. Vanilla attacks ran in the tree. **The brain still never picked
  an attack** (0 Attack candidates in 1508 decisions). Feint reset the attack timer (fixed in 0.3.1).
  288 in-range ticks fail on a gate we can't yet see; 0.3.1 logs which one.
- 0.3.1, run 5 (~1 min): no errors. Every in-range offense skip was `line of sight blocked` (102/102):
  the kLOS ray hits bodies. 0.3.2 ignores actor hits.
- 0.3.2, run 6 (~2.7 min): no warnings. **Brain attacks work:** light 20 posted/20 taken/18 with attack data,
  power 5/5/4. Offense skips are only the intended ones (116 within 0.3 s of its own swing, 55 target swinging).
  The skill roll dropped 58 of 70 Attack decisions (skill 33-55% early in the fight), by design. LOS blocks 30, all
  unnamed static refs. Circle side: 46 lines, not yet checked by eye.
- 0.4.0 (movement preemption): build-validated only.

**Next (for the user):**
1. Install 0.4.0 and fight bandits with one selected. Check:
   - movement follows the brain faster: the summary's `running moves stopped: ours N, vanilla N` is above 0;
   - no foot stutter. Many `Move ... stopped running vanilla node` lines every 0.3 s for the same actor means
     churn: our branch can't run, vanilla restarts;
   - no hang;
   - the circle side by eye: the `Circle ...: vanilla angle a -> b (brain side +1)` line should match the bandit
     circling to its own left.
2. Then (dev): Surround + fallback distance parameters. The custom leaf is parked (TREE_DESIGN §6: it adds
   dodge latency for a problem not yet seen).
**Last good version:** 0.3.2 (runtime-evidenced, run 6). Then 0.3.1 (run 5), 0.3.0 (run 4). Before that 0.2.2, then EnhancedCombatAI 1.10.2.
**Log:** `Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\CombatAITree.log`
(debug lines need `EnableDebugLog = true` under `[General]` in `CombatAITree.ini`, the shipped default;
they cover the actor selected in the console).

**Build:** `xmake f -m releasedbg --skyrim_se=y --skyrim_ae=y --skyrim_vr=n -y`, `xmake -y`, then
`pwsh scripts/package_release.ps1 <version>`. Output DLL: `build/SkyrimSEAE/skse/plugins/CombatAITree.dll`.
