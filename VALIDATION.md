## In-game test for 0.1.0 (AE 1.7.104)
1. Check `EnableDebugLog = true` under `[General]` in CombatAITree.ini (shipped default). Load a save, open the console, click a bandit, close the console.
2. Log has `Tree: Melee tree built` and `Tree: Block tree built` (once each), no errors.
3. Fight the bandit for 3+ minutes. Expect: it still attacks, power attacks, blocks and bashes
   (vanilla branches); debug lines `Intent ... post attack` followed by `tree took attack` and
   `VanillaAttack ... (intent)`, and the same for bash/block.
4. Fight a group (2-3 bandits + a follower), then a mage and an archer: no freezes, no CTD.
5. Save in combat, reload: combat resumes, no CTD.
6. Report: any NPC that stops attacking or never blocks, and the log.
